# ADOBE ADVERTISING AMO ID

## ADOBE ADVERTISING AMO ID {#amo-id}

AMO ID在较低的粒度级别跟踪每个唯一的广告组合，用于[!DNL Analytics]和Customer Journey Analytics数据分类以及从Adobe Advertising引入广告量度（例如展示次数、点击量和成本）。

对于[!DNL Analytics]，AMO ID存储在[eVar](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/dimensions/evar.html?lang=zh-Hans)或rVar维度(AMO ID)中。

对于Customer Journey Analytics，AMO ID存储在`trackingCode`对象的`conversionDetails`属性中，该对象是[&#x200B; [!UICONTROL Adobe Advertising Cloud ExperienceEvent Full Extension]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/zh-hans/docs/experience-platform/xdm/field-groups/event/advertising-full-extension)的一部分。

AMO ID也称为`s_kwcid`，有时发音为“[!DNL squid]”。

### AMO ID格式 {#amo-id-formats}

请参阅《Adobe Analytics组件指南》中的AMO ID维度项[的](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/zh-hans/docs/analytics/components/dimensions/amo-id#dimension-items)格式。
