# 关于 [!UICONTROL Asset Library]

<!-- Combine with "Create" page into one page once you can do more than just create/upload. Or still combine them and rename this page; you can't really "manage" assets here, just create/upload and see a list of assets you've previously uploaded (including a preview), but not edit existing uploaded assets or anything on the ad network. -->

*对象 [!DNL Google Ads] 和 [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] 仅限帐户*

在 [!UICONTROL Campaigns] > [!UICONTROL Asset Library]，您可以创建可重复使用的图像、视频和(用于 [!DNL Google Ads] 仅限)文本资源并将它们上传到 [!DNL Google Ads] 和 [!DNL Microsoft Advertising] 帐户级别的资产库。

在Advertising Search中创建或编辑效果最佳的营销活动时，您可以从特定于广告网络的资产库中的所有现有资产（包括您在此处上传的资产）中选择图像、徽标和视频。 您还可以上传新资产。

<!--
Should all assets on the ad network be listed in Campaigns > Asset Library by now, or just ones created/uploaded from our UI? (Within perf max campaign settings, you can select from all in the ad network's asset library, which should include assets uploaded from our UI. But I'm not sure that this list here is the same.) If all, then mention when they're updated.
