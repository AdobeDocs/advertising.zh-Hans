# 将<!-- and detach -->创意内容附加到创意包

*已关闭的测试版*

<!-- Edit all, including the metadata and title, plus the links within TOC and bundle-manage.md, once this feature is available. -->

您可以将标准创意附加到标准包，将动态创意附加到动态包，以便将其添加到[广告体验](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md)。 每个包只能包含每个\[创意大小+语言\]组合中的一个。

<!--
You can also detach a creative from a bundle to remove the association between the two, so that the creative is no longer used for experiences that target the bundle. Detaching a creative from the bundle doesn't delete the creative from the Creatives tab in your creative library.
